# pytorch_test
__A gentle introduction to PyTorch__

In the `PyTorch.ipynb` we will design a convolutional neural network with the help of the `torch` and `torchvison` libraries, train it using the computers GPU, evaluate the models performance and do inference in a small fun application. 

The data-set we'll be using is the famous MNIST handwritten digit data-set.
